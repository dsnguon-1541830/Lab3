# Airports in the United states
In this project, the goal was to create a web map that contains all airports in the United States. Each airport is solor coded to show whether or not it has an air traffic control tower. Green planes represent true while orange planes represent false. Each state is colored by the density of airports in each state with the darker color representing more airports. The airport data was taken from data.gov, the us states shapefiles were taken from Mike Bostock of D3, and the base map was taken from cartoDB.

The libraries used for the css of the map were taken from leaflet, font awesome, and google apis. The leaflet library was used for the interactive parts of the map such as the markers and the pop-ups that appear when clicking a marker to show "Y" or "N" for Air Traffic Control. The font awesome library was used to get the icon for the markers and the google apis were used to get the fonts used in the map.
